### OpenCV
* It is a library used world wide by many people in computer vision domain
* It is used in many areas like 
   1. Facial Recognition systems
   2. Gesture Recognition
   3. Image Processing
   4. and many more
* I have personally used it in Image Processing area and also for face,eyes recognition
* Currently working on using openCV for building attendence system and a sign detection system for deaf and dump people which comes under gesture recognition part
* Computer vision is one of the domain which I want to explore more and OpenCV fullfilly suppose my purpose of exploring CV domain
* It has many features like : ( these are the things I have worked with )
   1. reading,displaying,writing
   2. changing color of images ( grayscale to RGB or RGB to grayscale)
   3. resizing, image threshholding
   4. filtering( median, average , laplacian )
   5. edge detection
   6. face detection
